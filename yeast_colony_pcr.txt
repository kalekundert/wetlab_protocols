1. Setup the zymolase reaction:

   - 49.4 μL water
   - 3.33 μL OD 10.0 yeast
   - 0.6 μL 5 U/μL zymolase

2. Incubate at 37°C for 30 min, then at 95°C for 10 
   min.

3. Setup a 50 μL PCR reaction:

   - 15 μL water
   - 5 μL primer mix
   - 5 μL zymolase reaction
   - 25 μL 2x Q5 master mix

4. Run the PCR for 22 cycles with a 12s extension 
   time.

5. Run 5 μL of the product on a gel to make sure the 
   reaction worked.
   
Notes
=====
[1] All the protocols I looked at assume that you're picking a single colony 
    for PCR.  I want to start the PCR from liquid culture, because I have a 
    library, but I also want to use a similar number of cells as what the 
    protocols expect:

    1 colony ≈ 1e6 cells (bionumbers 100266 v5)
    OD 1.0 ≈ 3e7 cells/mL

    Assuming I have an overnight culture at OD 10.0:
    
    (1e6 cells) / (3e8 cells/mL) / (1e3 μL / 1 mL) = 3.33 μL o/n
