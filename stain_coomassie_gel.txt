1. Place gel in Coomassie stain

2. Microwave on high for 1 min, then shake for 10-20 minutes.  Be careful, 
   because Coomassie stain has methanol and you don't want to breathe methanol 
   fumes.

3. Replace the stain with destain and wadded-up Kimwipes.  Microwave on high 
   for 1 min and shake for 10-20 minutes

4. Repeat the destain step as necessary.
