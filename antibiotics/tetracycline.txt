- Prepare 10 mg/mL (1000x) tetracycline [1,2]:

  - 400 mg anhydrous tetracycline HCl
  - 40 mL 70% EtOH
  - Store at -20Â°C, wrapped in foil.

Notes:

[1] Tetracycline is chelated by magnesium ions, and thus unsuitable for use in 
    minimal media.  

[2] Some recipes call for filter sterilization, but I believe that this is 
    unnecessary because the solution is 70% EtOH.
