- Prepare 100 mg/mL (1000x) carbenicillin:

  - 4 g carbenicillin disodium salt
  - 40 mL 50% EtOH [1]
  - Store at −20°C

Notes:

[1] Most recipes call for carbenicillin to dissolved 
    in water, but 50% ethanol also works and is more 
    convenient because it can be stored at −20°C 
    without freezing.
