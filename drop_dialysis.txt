1. Exchange buffers using drop dialysis [1].

   - Pour 30–100 ml of dialysis buffer into a petri 
     plate or beaker.

   - Float a 25 mm diameter, Type-VS Millipore 
     membrane (MF type, VS filter, mean pore size = 
     0.025 μm, Millipore, Inc. #VSWP 02500) shiny 
     side up on the dialysis buffer. Make sure there 
     are no air bubbles trapped under the filter.

   - Allow the floating filter to wet completely 
     (~5 minutes) before proceeding. 

   - Pipette your sample (5–100 µL) carefully onto 
     the center of the filter [2-4]. 

   - Cover the petri plate or beaker and dialyze for 
     1 to 4 hours [5].

   - Carefully retrieve the DNA droplet and transfer 
     to a clean tube.  For maximal recovery, rinse 
     the spot on the membrane with buffer.

[2] The filter has a tendency to move briskly around 
    the surface as you touch it with the pipette tip. 
    Practice with buffer droplets to master the 
    technique before using a valuable sample.

[3] If the sample has too much organic solvent (e.g.  
    phenol or chloroform), the drop will not remain 
    in the center of the membrane and the dialysis 
    should be discontinued until the organics are 
    further removed.  For nucleic acids, this is 
    performed by alcohol precipitation of the sample. 

[4] It is possible to fit ~9 small droplets on a 
    single filter, if necessary.

[5] The concentration of NaCl decreases with a 
    half-life of 15 minutes during drop dialysis.
