1. For each electrotransformation:

  - Pre-warm 1 mL SOC and a selective plate.
  
  - Chill an electroporation cuvette and 2 μL 
    (≈250 ng) of DNA on ice.  
  
  - Thaw an aliquot of competent cells on ice for 
    ~10 min.
  
  - Pipet once to mix the cells with the DNA, then 
    load into the cuvette.  Tap to remove bubbles.
  
  - Shock at 1.8 kV with a 5 ms decay time (for 
    cuvettes with a 1 mm gap).
  
  - Immediately add 1 mL pre-warmed SOC.  If you're 
    transforming multiple aliquots of cells with the 
    same DNA, combine them.
  
  - Recover at 37°C for 1h.
    
  - Plate several 10x dilutions of cells (e.g. 10⁻³ 
    to 10⁻⁶) to count how many were transformed.
  
  - Add 50 mL selective media and grow overnight at 
    37°C.  Miniprep or miraprep the next morning.
