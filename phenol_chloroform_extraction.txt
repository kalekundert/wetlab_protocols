1. Dilute your nucleic acid sample to 100-700 µL or 
   divide your samples into tubes such that you have 
   no more than 700 µL per tube. It is difficult to 
   do the extraction with volumes smaller than 100 
   µL. The sample can be concentrated again after 
   precipitation.
   
2. Add an equal volume of phenol to the tube, vortex 
   vigorously to mix the phases.

3. Spin in a microfuge at top speed for 1-2 min to 
   separate the phases.

4. Remove the aqueous phase to a new tube, being 
   careful not to transfer any of the protein at the 
   phase interface.

5. Repeat the phenol extraction two more times.

6. Extract the sample two times with an equal volume 
   of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol to remove any trace 
   phenol.

7. Precipitate the nucleic acid.
