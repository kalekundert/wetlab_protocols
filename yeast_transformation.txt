Day 1
=====
1. Pick a colony and grow overnight in 5 mL YPD at 
   30°C with shaking.
   
   Don't do this to much past 5:00, otherwise the 
   overnight culture won't really be saturated.

2. Place the following items and buffers at 4°C 
   overnight:

   - 10 mL milliQ water
   - 10 mL 1M LiOAc
   - 10 mL 50% PEG
   - 2 1.5 mL tubes per transformation

Day 2
=====
1. Inoculate fresh YPD with enough overnight culture 
   to reach OD 0.15.

   Use 15 mL media per transformation (e.g. 60 mL for 
   4 transformations).  The overnight culture should 
   be near OD 10.0.

2. Grow at 30°C until the cells reach OD 0.7 (≈5h).

3. Linearize the DNA you're transforming by 
   restriction digest:

   - 3 μL water
   - 5 μL DNA
   - 1 μL 10x CutSmart buffer
   - 1 μL NotI-HF

   Incubate at 37°C for 20 min, then at 65°C for
   20 min.

4. Transfer the cells to one or more 50 mL Falcon 
   tubes and pellet them at 3000g for 2 min.

5. Resuspend the cells in 800 μL cold water and 
   transfer them to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.

From this point on, the cells and all reagents should 
be kept on ice unless otherwise specified.

6. Pellet the cells at 3000g for 3 min at 4°C.

7. Pipet off the water, then estimate the volume of 
   the cells and resuspend them in an equal volume of 
   cold water.

8. Make as many 50 μL aliquots as you can/need.  

9. Pellet the aliquots at 3000g for 3 min at 4°C, 
   then pipet off the extra water.  There should be 
   about 25 μL cells in each aliquot.

9. Prepare the following mixture for each 
   transformation:

   - 36 μL 1M LiOAc
   - 10 μL 2 mg/mL ssDNA (boiled for 5 min)
   - 1 μL DNA (linearized)
   - 73 μL water

   Chill on ice.

10. Gently mix 120 μL of each mixture into an aliquot 
    of cells.

11. Add 240 μL PEG to each transformation and vortex 
    well to resuspend the cells.

12. Heat shock at 42°C for 40 min.

13. Pellet the cells at 3000g for 3 min and pipet off 
    the supernatant.

14. Resuspend the cells in 3 mL YPD.

15. Recover the cells at 30°C for 3h.  This seems to 
    be unnecessary for the LEU marker.

16. Plate 200 uL on selective plates and incubate for 
    2 days at 30°C.
