100 mL 3M sodium acetate (pH 5)
───────────────────────────────
- 24.6 g anhydrous sodium acetate *or* 40.8 g sodium acetate trihydrate
- milliQ water to ≈60 mL
- stir to dissolve (30 min)
- adjust pH to 5.0 with glacial acetic acid (≈20 mL, work in a hood)
- milliQ water to 100 mL

Notes:
- I tried to use pH paper to track the titration until I got close to pH 5.0, 
  but I overshot because the paper was not accurate (maybe it was expired).  
  Next time, I would try just adding 15 mL of acetic acid to get close, then 
  taking it out of the hood and measuring it's pH every time I add more acid.
