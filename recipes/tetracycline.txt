- Prepare 5 mg/mL (250x) tetracycline [1,2]:

  - 400 mg anhydrous tetracycline HCl
  - 80 mL 70% EtOH
  - Store at -20Â°C

Notes:

[1] Some recipes call for filter sterilization, but I believe that this is 
    unnecessary because the solution is 70% EtOH.

[2] Tetracycline is chelated by magnesium ions, and thus unsuitable for use in 
    minimal media [openwetware].
