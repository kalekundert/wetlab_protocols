Prepare Samples for SDS-PAGE
============================
1. Take the 1X BugBuster out of the fridge in the gel 
   room and bring it to room temperature.  Make sure 
   all of the detergent dissolves.  You can put the 
   bottle on the 37°C block to speed the process up.

2. Begin with a 1mL aliquot of cells.

3. Pellet cells by spinning for 1 min at max speed 
   (>10,000g) on a tabletop centrifuge.  Discard the 
   supernatant.

4. Resuspend the cell pellet in 200μL 1X BugBuster.  
   Pipette to mix.

5. Incubate the mixture on a shaking platform at room 
   temperature until it is no longer cloudy (~5 min).

6. Take a 20μL "lysate" aliquot.  Add 4μL 6X PSB to 
   the aliquot, then keep it at room temperature.

7. Separate the soluble and insoluble fractions by 
   centrifuging at 21,000g for 30 min at 4°C.

8. Take a 20μL "soluble" aliquot from the super- 
   natant.  Add 4μL 6X PSB to the aliquot, then keep 
   it at room temperature.  Discard the rest of the 
   supernatant.

9. Resuspend the insoluble pellet in 180μL 25mM Tris.

10. Take a 20μL "insoluble" aliquot.  Add 4μL 6X PSB 
    to the aliquot, then keep it at room temperature.

11. Incubate the "lysate" and "soluble" aliquots at 
    100°C for 5 min, and incubate the "insoluble" 
    aliquot at 100°C for 15 min.
