1. Take the 1X BugBuster out of the fridge in the gel 
   room and bring it to room temperature.  Make sure 
   all of the detergent dissolves.  You can put the 
   bottle on the 37°C block to speed the process up.

2. Begin with a 1mL aliquot of cells.

3. Pellet cells by spinning for 1 min at 10,000g on a 
   tabletop centrifuge.  Discard the supernatant.

4. Resuspend the cell pellet in 200 μL 1X BugBuster.  
   Pipette to mix.

5. Incubate the mixture on a shaking platform at room 
   temperature until it is no longer cloudy (~5 min).

6. Take a 20 μL "lysate" aliquot.  Add 4 μL 6X PSB to 
   the aliquot, then keep it at room temperature.

7. Separate the soluble and insoluble fractions by 
   centrifuging at 21,000g for 30 min at 4°C.

8. Take a 20 μL "soluble" aliquot from the super- 
   natant.  Add 4 μL 6X PSB to the aliquot.

9. Resuspend the insoluble pellet in 180 μL of 25 mM 
   Tris.

10. Take a 20 μL "insoluble" aliquot.  Add 4 μL 6X 
    PSB to the aliquot.

11. Incubate the "lysate" and "soluble" aliquots at 
    100°C for 5 min, and incubate the "insoluble" 
    aliquot at 100°C for 15 min.

12. Load on a PAGE gel and run at ???V for ???min.
