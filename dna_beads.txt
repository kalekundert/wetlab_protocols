- Purify DNA using magnetic beads [1].

  - Gently resuspend the bead solution [2].
  - Add 1 volume of bead solution to each sample.
  - Incubate 5 min at RT.
  - Apply magnet for >2 min and discard supernatant.
  - Wash twice:
    - Add 200 µL 70% EtOH.
    - Incubate 30 sec at RT.
    - Apply to magnet and discard ethanol.
  - Air-dry for 4-5 minutes [3].
  - Add any volume of eluant.
  - Apply magnet for >2 min.
  - Transfer ≈95% of the eluant to a clean tube.

Notes:

[1] See "Magnetic Bead DNA Purification" in my Google 
    Drive for more details.

[2] Don't vortex; this damages the beads (somehow).

[3] Be careful not to over-dry the beads.  Over-dried
    beads will appear cracked and will be difficult 
    to resuspend.  If this happens, heat and agitate 
    for 10-15 minutes during elution to help 
    resuspend the beads and release the DNA.  An 
    alternative strategy is to add the eluant after a 
    very short drying step, then leaving the tubes 
    open for 10-15 minutes to allow the ethanol to 
    evaporate.
