1. Stain with Coomassie:

   - Submerge the gel in fresh stain.
   - Microwave on high for 30 sec [1].
   - Gently shake for 5â€“10 minutes.
   - Rinse twice with water.

   - Repeat until the background is clear:
     - Submerge the gel in fresh destain.
     - Microwave on high for 30 sec.
     - Place a wadded-up kimwipe in the destain.
     - Gently shake for 10 min.

2. Image with a laser scanner [2]:

   - laser: 658 nm
   - filter: 710BP40

Note:
[1] Coomassie stain contains methanol, so avoid 
    breathing fumes when using the microwave.

[2] Note that Coomassie seems to quench fluorophores 
    like FITC/GFP.  I don't know exactly why this is.
