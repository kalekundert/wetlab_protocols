1. Setup a 50 mL bacterial culture in appropriate 
   selective media and incubate on a shaker (250 rpm) 
   at 37°C overnight.

2. Transfer bacteria to a 50 mL Falcon tube and spin 
   at 3270xg at 4°C for 20 min.

3. Discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 2 mL 
   resuspension buffer (P1) with 50 μg/mL RNase (5 μL 
   20 mg/mL) freshly added.

4. Add 2 mL of lysis buffer (P2), invert 3-4 times 
   and incubate for 3 min at RT.

5. Add 2 mL of neutralization buffer (N3) and invert 
   3-4 times.

6. Distribute lysate into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes (~4 
   tubes) by pouring, not pipetting.

7. Spin at 13,200xg at RT for 10 min.

8. Collect supernatants in a 15 mL tube and discard 
   pellets.

9. Add 1x volume of 96% ethanol (~5 mL).

10. Mix thoroughly for 5 sec.

11. Load the sample-ethanol mix onto 4 spin-columns.  

12. Wash with 500 µL washing buffer (PE).

13. Wash with 500 μL washing buffer (PE) again.

14. Spin at 13,200xg at RT for 1.5 min to remove 
    residual ethanol.

15. Add 30-35 µL of ddH2O to each spin-column and 
    incubate for 2 min at RT.

16. Spin at 13,200xg for 2 min to elute the DNA (into 
    a fresh tube).

17. Combine the eluted DNA from all 4 columns in one 
    tube (~140 µL).

18. Measure DNA concentration.

19. Store samples at -20°C.
